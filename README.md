When doing project 4 i did some changes to this project to get the RESTAPI to work.

I have some weird issue with GitHub again and it wont accept my files and i can only add them manually to GitHub.

node_modules file has too many files in it so i cant upload that.
You can get my application to work by typing "npm install mongoose" and "npm install express â€“save" to the terminal on visual studio code
